            <h4>Bar & Restaurant</h4>
            <p>
              Whether it is a Pub, Bar, Restaurant or Caffè, having the right
              equipment in place is essential. It can make or break your place.
              Hence, you must be extraordinarily prudent in choosing the right
              and the most appropriate one as per your requirements and
              <strong>we can help you with that</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, restaurant equipment can be broadly divided into three
              groups:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Kitchen Equipment - </strong> The equipment that you find
              in a restaurant kitchen is very different from the ones you will
              see in your house. For a restaurant kitchen, you will need to
              purchase commercial grade stoves, refrigerators, freezers, fryers,
              mixers, blenders, steamers, and slicers as well as dishwashers,
              coffee makers, beverage dispensers, and more. You will also need a
              variety of pots, pans, measuring cups and spoons, and utensils to
              prepare food.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Front-of-House Equipment - </strong> Once you have your
              kitchen equipment in place, you’ll need to focus on what you need
              in front of the house. In other words, where your guests will be
              served. Tables and chairs, of course, are the essential
              prerequisites but also condiment dispensers, salt and pepper
              shakers, silverware, glassware, and paper goods.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Operational Equipment - </strong> Last but not least we
              can talk about operational equipment. Nowadays, it is very
              unlikely that a restaurant owner plans to deal with his restaurant
              operations manually. Hence, there has been a proliferation of
              demand for the items that help in the restaurant operations. Be it
              cash-registers, credit-card processing machine or a restaurant
              management systems, these are being increasingly used by the
              restaurants to make its operations seamless.

            <h4>Bakery & Confectionery</h4>
            <p>
              The early mornings, the handcrafted dough, the smell of
              fresh-baked goods filling the air – there’s something universally
              appealing about starting your own bakery. Running a successful
              bakery takes more than a passion for baking, though. It also
              requires skill and the right pieces of restaurant equipment to get
              the job done right every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The right kitchen equipment for a bakery business can became
              really expensive since most of it is made up of stainless steel,
              on the other hand it is usually tough and long lasting. The major
              equipment required in the bakery are Planetary Mixers, Oven, Deep
              Fridge, Cooling Fridge, Working table, Gas stove, Cylinders,
              storage utensils and other.
            </p>
            <p>
              The display area or the front end of the bakery should be well
              designed and created in a manner that each and every item is
              noticeable so as to attract the walk-in customers. You mainly
              require a Display fridge for cakes and pastries. Other than the
              fridge, display area should have a proper storage and a display
              rack for the items.

            <h4>Grocery Store & Supermarket</h4>
            <p>
              Opening a grocery store or supermarket can be an incredibly
              overwhelming process. Aside from the incredibly large quantity of
              front-end equipment needed, including check out and office
              equipment, there are a number of commercial pieces of equipment to
              sell, preserve, and store the tremendous amount of food that moves
              through a grocery store.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern consumers demand a high level of transparency from the
              companies that create and sell, the food they eat. As a grocery
              store entrepreneur, you can meet your customer's standards by
              making sound business decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Surely own a business like this requires purchasing equipment.
              Some necessary items will include freezers for perishables,
              slicers to cut deli meats and cheese, and display cases to
              showcase pastries and breads. Use the floor layout plan to
              envision additional items: The produce aisle, for example, needs
              carts, sponge matting to hold the fruit and vegetables, misters,
              plastic bags, weights, and additional shelving to hold less
              perishable items such as dried fruit and nuts.

            stands now, we offer discounts on hundreds of selected items.
            However we cannot confirm when, if ever, an item will be discounted
            or how long the discount will remain so.
